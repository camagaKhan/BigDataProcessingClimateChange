What are GHG emissions?

GHG emissions, or greenhouse gas emissions, refer to the release of gases into the Earth's atmosphere that trap heat and contribute to global warming and climate change. The most common greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), although other gases such as fluorinated gases (e.g., HFCs, PFCs, SF6) also contribute to warming.

GHG emissions come from a variety of sources, including burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, industrial processes, and deforestation. These activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, which can stay there for decades to centuries. Additionally, agriculture and livestock production also release significant amounts of methane and nitrous oxide.

The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to a range of impacts such as sea level rise, more frequent and severe heatwaves, and changes in precipitation patterns. To address climate change, it is important to reduce GHG emissions through actions such as increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, reducing deforestation, and improving agricultural practices.
