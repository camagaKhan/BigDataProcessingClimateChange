Hi, for this assignment we'll be using **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Spark**. This readme file will be updated as the solution improves and grows. This solution is tested and produced using Ubuntu

> v: Ubuntu 22.04.2; LTS : Release: 22.04; Codename: jammy 

### What you will need to run this solution: 


```
pip install kafka-python
pip3 install findspark

```

I use ```kafka-python``` to create the topics, producers, and consumers
```findspark``` is used to bridge the location of where you installed the spark framework. We'll be using **Python** for this as well =]
