Hi, for this assignment we'll be using **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Spark**. This readme file will be updated as the solution improves and grows.

### What you will need to run this solution: 


```
pip install kafka-python
pip3 install findspark

```

I use ```kafka-python``` to create the topics, producers, and consumers
```findspark``` is used to bridge the location of where you installed the spark solution. We'll be using **Python** for this as well =]
